# Implement Neural Network with Plain Python and Numpy
Although its name sounds fancy, the algorithm and building block of Neural Network is actually very simple. In this project, I have implemented a 2 layers (1 hidden and 1 output layer) shallow neural network from scratch with only Python and Numpy. Then I use the Neural Network to classify digit 0,1 of MNIST handwritten digits dataset.
